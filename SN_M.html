							<h1>Soma-Noti [Accepted CHI 2021]</h1>
							<h2>[User Study]</h2>
							<b>Comparison of Notification Channels for
								On-Clothing Wearables</b>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Info/SN/1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2></h2>We investigate the idea of delivering notifications through
							devices worn on the underside of a user’s clothing.
							A wearable worn in such a manner is in direct contact
							with a user’s skin.
							We leverage this proximity to test the performance of 10
							on-skin sensations as methods of notification delivery.
							We developed prototypes for each stimulus and
							conducted a user study to evaluate them across 6
							locations found commonly covered by clothing.
							To investigate the effectiveness of different on-skin
							sensations across locations, we created hardware
							prototypes for wearable badges with
							two components:</p>
							
				
							<ol>
								<li>a set of ten badges equipped with
								different types of actuators</li>
								<li>a fanny pack containing the
									microcontroller and power source
									which acts as our processing unit</li>
							</ol>
								
							
								<h2>User Study</h2>
								<p>The experiment was a 10 x 6 within-subject design with two independent variables:
									10 channel: Press, Poke, Pinch, Heat, Cool,Blow, Suck, Vibrate, Moisture, Brush
									6 body location: Collar bone, Shoulder, Stomach, Side of the torso, Upper arm, Lower back.
									The orders of channel and location were counterbalanced with Latin Square. We considered
									two dependent variables: Response Time (RT) and Error Rate (ER). We also asked the
									participants to rate each location-channel pair for comfort and each channel for a sense of
									urgency on a five-point Likert scale.
									</p>
								

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Info/SN/2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>For each output, a participant was given a demonstration of the stimulus from the badge and then asked to wear it at one of the six body locations. After wearing the badge, participants were instructed to hold their phone in their hands (with our app open) and walk at a normal pace around a track constructed in our laboratory. </p>	

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Info/SN/5.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The walking direction was counterbalanced between clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. We chose walking as it has a slightly greater cognitive load than sitting or standing still, and thus it is a
									more robust testing condition.
									While walking, they were introduced with the stimulus 5 times at random intervals. 
									Participants were instructed to press the button on the app as soon as they felt a stimulus. 
									No feedback was given on responding. Participants answered online survey questions between the different outputs and locations. 
									We ran 10 x 6 x 5 (channel x location x repetition) trials, for a total of 300 trials per participant.
								
								</p>		

								<p><b>User Demographics</b></p>

								<ul>
									<li>Age: 18-28</li>
									<li>12 Participants: 4 females, 8 Males</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>RESULTS</h2>
								<p>We conducted the first study on
									notification channels in the
									context of devices attached to our
									everyday clothing. 
									Collar bone, shoulder and
									upper arm are the most suitable
									locations due to lower error
									rates and higher comfort ratings.
									Results indicate significant
									differences in reaction time and
									error rates which may influence the
									design of future on-clothing
									wearables.
								
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Info/SN/3.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>We found
									out that error rate is affected by
									body location while reaction
									time is only affected by channel.</p>
